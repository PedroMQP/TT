Katie Ka-Boom? The Godfather-inspired pigeons?”“Then why did Pinky and the Brain get a spin-off?” Patrick countered, lifting his second Manhattan along with his skeptical brow.“Because it was the most obvious?” Candace suggested, making a face like that was too. “That doesn’t make it the most brill—”But then she stopped. Because between the half bottle of wine and the way he was looking at her, and the surprise that still lingered from the moment she’d walked in, having made a more-than-lip-gloss-but-less-than-leg-shaving effort toward the blind date, which she’d agreed to, after he’d rescheduled twice, only because the restaurant he’d suggested had a salmon preparation she particularly liked, and found him reading the New Yorker, which was as contradictory to the expectations she’d set based on the sharp suit and look of disdain in his LinkedIn profile picture as the conversation he’d immediately begun—about the implications of want and need being the same word in Arabic, which he’d just read about in the magazine’s review of Lawrence Faber’s new film—she’d lost track of what she was going to say.Her cheeks flushed, unaccustomed to such a situation, and she concluded: “Well, no one is perfect.”“Disagree,” he said, reaching for his spoon.“Is that so?” she laughed, lifting a brow.“Perfection is just flawless alignment with a set of ideals,” he said, enjoying himself. “And since ideals are subjective, if I align with my own, I must be perfect.”“A perfect version of yourself, maybe, but surely you believe in some universal ideals that are perfect in and of themselves?”“One,” he said.“And that is?”“Love.”His eyes hung on hers as the word hung in the air, and she realized her heart had skipped a beat only when it started to work normally again.And even though the lighting was dim, she thought she saw his cheeks redden as he dropped his eyes and spoon down to the remains of the chocolate torte on the plate between them.“I don’t mean to imply I haven’t made imperfect decisions,” he went on as he broke a piece of chocolate with the tip of his spoon.“I eagerly await the examples,” she said, watching him as she reached for her wine.“Well, going back to our earlier discussion,” he said, lifting the spoon to his mouth, “I played the jingle from Pinky and the Brain at my fifth-grade piano recital.”Candace laughed, and he smiled, licking the cream off his spoon, like he’d guessed she was the kind to be charmed by childhood nerdiness.“If it makes you feel any better, I played Whitney Houston’s ‘One Moment in Time’ at mine,” she said.“That’s not so—”“And sang,” she interrupted. “Dramatically.”This time he laughed.“Do you still play?”“No,” she said, a bit too quickly.He noticed and glanced up from the plate.Her pulse quickened and she hurried to say I just got out of the habit, but something about the way he was looking at her made something in her not want to lie.“My mother taught me,” she heard herself say, looking down at her hands, where one thumbnail had started scratching the other. “And after she died, it was just really hard.”“I’m so sorry,” he said, his voice soft.“Not your fault,” she said, the way she’d learned to do, forcing a smile as she dropped her hands and looked back up.“I know,” he said, his eyes as secure in compassion as they had been in argumentation. “But I’m still sorry she’s gone.”Candace bit the inside of her lip, willing her eyes to hold back their heat.“I mean,” he went on, like he wouldn’t judge her if she couldn’t, “just imagine how proud she’d be to see you dating such a great guy.”Candace gave in to a laugh that made a tear escape. She wiped it away and shook her head to gather herself again, but she couldn’t keep from imagining her mother saying, as she would have done, Aye yai yai.Which made her smile, too, and when she looked up at Patrick, she found him similarly situated, like he was neither afraid of her vulnerability nor without pride in his capacity to make it less hard.“Do you want to get out of here?” he asked.“Yeah,” she said, and they held each other’s eyes for another moment, as if to confirm that the other felt it, too, before his smile curled higher and he turned to get the bill. [image file=image_rsrc5A.jpg] As Candace watched him flag down the server, she allowed her mind to wander forward to what would come next: to the way his arm now lifting to get the check would feel wrapped around her waist and the way the mouth that said thank you would taste pressing against hers. She imagined the fingers now opening the billfold reaching under her shirt and unhooking her bra and pulling her panties off. She imagined the intense focus with which he now reviewed the receipt directed at her body’s pleasure and his fearlessly penetrating eyes peering into hers as his equally confident cock pressed inside her, where hot want was already beginning to—“So, should we split it?”Candace’s imagining screeched to a halt.He glanced up, innocent.She blinked.He lifted a brow.She waited for him to laugh.He didn’t.The desire between her legs shriveled like a salt-doused slug, and she thought she heard a sound . . . Was that a mic dropping?She narrowed her eyes and set her jaw, studying him.He matched her posture, standing his ground.“In a gender-equal society, it’s as insulting to you as it is to me to expect men to pay for dinner,” he said.She waited. He could do better than that.He sensed the gravity and sat forward, lifting his finger now to make his case.“I’m an adamant feminist, Candace, and I respect you enough to tell you that I have no interest in being with a woman who doesn’t want to be treated with absolute equality in all regards, which, quite clearly, extends to expenses as well as benefits.”Candace heard his argument and considered it patiently.She then reconsidered him, more objectively this time.She considered the lines in his brow and the gray specks in his hair and the fact that he had, at forty-two, never been married. She considered the possibility that this was because he had an Oedipus complex or a small penis or a neurotic fear of germs, then settled on the probability that his standards were so high and his convictions so uncompromising that, even if she met them sufficiently for this to turn into something long term, they would always make decisions unnecessarily difficult.She considered how he would always work too much, and how that would bring with it canceled plans and evenings alone and her sometimes having to remind him she needed attention, which would make her feel needy and small. She considered how hard he would always be on himself and, by extension, sometimes on her, and also on their children if they had any, who might also end up with his oversize ears.But she also considered him teaching those children piano jingles, and how it would feel to walk in and find them on the bench, him sitting between a little boy and a little girl, plucking the notes to “Heart and Soul,” and sense her mother there too.She considered the way his intellect would challenge her, and the way his ambition would inspire her to do bigger things; she considered how he would make her laugh and show sensitivity when she needed it; and she considered how undeniably rare she knew, after ten years of dating, it was to find a man who could, in the course of four hours, make her feel sexy and smart and safe and understood.She considered, in other words, whether he was worth it, and she decided that he was.And so Candace released Patrick from the hold of her eyes and turned for her purse, in which she dug for her wallet. She pulled it up on the table and unsnapped the flap and pressed it open, then flipped behind the credit card slots to where cash would have gone if she ever carried cash, but instead kept an eight-by-eleven piece of paper, folded in thirds.She took the paper out and opened it, then handed it across the table to him to read. [image file=image_rsrc5B.jpg] His posture contracted as he took in her calculations.“I, too, believe in equality,” she said to his bowed head as he studied the paper. “And that the foundation of equality is transparency.”She watched his Adam’s apple tense.“I would be more than happy to adjust any of my assumptions regarding your expenses, or to explain the necessity of my own, though I think you’ll find any outside opinions will confirm that I have been very conservative in what I’ve included, and, moreover, demonstrated a well-honed understanding as regards what can be bought cheaply and what justifies proper financial investment.”She directed him, by way of example, to the inexpensive bronzer she’d paired with a quality sable-hair blush brush.He looked up, his lips parted, his eyes just a little scared.She calmly picked up the check and read the total, then reached back into her purse for a pen and did the calculation on his cocktail napkin.“So, unless there’s something there to dispute,” she said, passing him the napkin, “why don’t you pick up dinner, and then you can just owe me flowers?”He blinked at her calculation, his mouth still agape, then looked back up at her and narrowed his eyes.He studied her for a long moment, and she folded her hands in her lap and calmly waited for him to complete whatever constituted the male equivalent of the examination she had done of him a few moments before.“All set?” the server asked, returning to the table.Neither of them moved.Then, without taking his eyes off her, Patrick reached into his pocket and lifted his credit card between two fingers.And once the server had taken it and they were alone again, Patrick leaned forward over the table and said in a low voice, his eyes filling with a new kind of intensity that flooded all her senses with a thrill, “Enjoy this feeling of being on top, Candace, because when I get you home, I am going to absolutely ravage you.”To which she leaned in, equally fearless, and said, “Perfect.”ABOUT THE AUTHOR [image file=image_rsrc5C.jpg] Photo © Khristopher MorganMichelle Miller wrote pseudonymously until the publication of her debut novel, The Underwriting, which was translated into twenty languages and developed for television with Fox.
