She had a master’s degree in art history and a published thesis on graffiti art by way of credentials, and given her access to capital and the general entrepreneurial sentiment of the times, it had only made sense that she get on with opening her own gallery, even if she was only twenty-six.And so she had found a thousand square feet on the Lower East Side, on a street that was dirty enough to make respectable people feel cutting-edge when they visited but far enough from Chinatown that they weren’t put off by the stench. She’d built a business plan and defined her points of differentiation; she’d created a budget and a marketing plan; she’d hired two attractive interns willing to work for free; and she’d scouted and signed seven artists—four painters, two photographers, and a sculptor from Montreal—all of whom had shown pieces at tonight’s event to immense and immediate intrigue.The elevator doors opened, and Clyde held the door.“You have a good night,” he said.“Thank you,” she said, stepping into the car and turning to face the doors, holding her spine straight, her neck long, her chin lifted, her shoulders back, her stomach in, her ankles together, her hands crossed just below her navel, and waited for the doors to close.At which point her spine sank as her head and shoulders dropped forward and her eyes closed, fighting back the sob.Her mother hadn’t come.She’d first noticed her absence at quarter to six, when the thought had struck her that it would be so nice if she came early to make sure Lauren was feeling ready and calm. She’d noticed it again at six thirty, when Anna Wintour had stopped by, and she’d wished for her mother to see the woman’s presence as validation that the gallery was a big deal.She’d noticed it when David Merced, a family friend whose job was just as big and demanding and high profile as her mother’s, had found the time to make it, and she’d noticed it when the publicist handed her the microphone to make the remarks she’d prepared, and all she could see among the packed room’s faces was the fact her mother wasn’t there.She’d noticed it for the next two hours, when it became clear she was going to miss it, and for the hour after that, when Lauren started drinking champagne in an effort not to care. And, finally, Lauren noticed her mother’s absence as the last guest left, and she stayed to cover the art and lock up and found herself glancing at the door, wishing her mother would come in with a long list of excuses, because at that point the routine she’d despised in adolescence would have been nicer than nothing at all.The elevator stopped, and the doors opened.Lauren sucked in a breath and resumed her posture as she stepped out into the hall.At least now she knew, irrefutably, that whatever she did would never be enough.When Catherine was Lauren’s age, she’d already made several million dollars as one of the only female traders on Wall Street and was elbowing her way through Harvard Business School as she laid the groundwork to become the Most Powerful Woman on Wall Street and the presumptive heir to L. Cecil’s CEO throne.Even if Lauren accomplished the art-world equivalent, it would still, to her mother, only be art and only possible because of the education and trust fund and access to a high-powered network Catherine’s hard work had afforded.She got to the end of the hall and slipped the key into the lock, pushing open the door just as the phone in the kitchen rang.She kicked off her shoes and turned on the light as she moved to answer it.“I’m so sorry to disturb you,” Clyde said. “But I forgot that someone delivered a package for you earlier this evening. Shall I bring it up?”“Yes, of course,” she told him, then hung up the phone and paused, her attention abruptly captured by the possibility of what it might be.Would Anna Wintour have sent her something, with a little note saying Well done? Or Jerry Saltz, who had stopped by and looked decidedly less than usually unpleased? Or what if it was something from Carter, the guy she’d met and gone home with at Frieze last year, saying he’d read about the gallery in New York mag and just wanted to congratulate her, and also say he was sorry for disappearing and see if she was still single and, if so, might give him a second chance?She heard the elevator and moved back to open the door.“Sorry again that I forgot about it,” Clyde said as he came down the hall, holding out a glossy white box tied with a white grosgrain ribbon and a little light-pink card.“It’s fine,” she said, taking it from him and carrying it inside.Lauren’s apartment was a corner penthouse with high ceilings and one bedroom and an open living space, with a dining table where she sat and hurriedly slid the card out of the envelope, her chest tightening when she read:Good luck tonight —MomLauren’s body was still, but her nerves shook as she stared at the words, written in her mother’s assistant’s handwriting, and felt them press against her like a brand.She willed herself to reserve feeling until she had all the facts and moved to the package, untying the ribbon and sliding her fingernail to break the tape. She pulled off the lid, and when she saw what the box contained, her heartbeat quickened, her eyes welled with heat, and she said, aloud, “You bitch.”Cupcakes.Her mother had sent her cupcakes. Twelve of them, in assorted flavors and colors and sprinkle patterns, neatly arranged in four columns and three rows. They were from Magnolia Bakery, because that was where her mother used to take her after ballet class when she was six and seven and eight and nine, and smile as she sipped her coffee and Lauren devoured her sugar, and they talked about whatever was on Lauren’s mind. It had been their thing, every Saturday, until Lauren turned ten and discovered calories and that mothers weren’t cool, whereupon Catherine determined that, if Lauren was just going to sit there drinking water and not talking, the nanny might as well pick her up from ballet class so she didn’t have to divert her attention from work.Lauren’s blood began to burn as she stared at the cupcakes in her lap.Did she seriously think this was kind?Or was she intentionally laughing at her?Was not showing up for the most important event of her life simply insufficient to mold Lauren into the hard, hateful woman Catherine evidently wanted her to be?Because what the fuck kind of mother sent eight thousand calories’ worth of cupcakes to a daughter she knew, because she’d made her go to rehab for it, had had an eating disorder for the past fifteen years?The heat spilled over into rage and she hurled the box against the wall.“I HATE YOU!” she screamed as the box smashed against the ivory paint, smearing it with frosting as broken bits of cake fell down onto the rug.Lauren’s chest heaved as she glared at the mess across the room, making her conscious of how tight the bodice of her strapless cocktail dress was around it.She then noticed how tight it was around her stomach, and from there her attention leaped to the backs of her arms and the insides of her thighs and the skin beneath her chin. And before she could stop it, her brain raced to recall how many hors d’oeuvres she’d eaten and how much champagne she’d drunk, and to calculate the shameful surplus of calories, each one of which she felt, now, forming into fat as the anger she’d accumulated effortlessly redirected itself from the cupcakes back in.“Stop!” she yelled, her face twisting as she pushed up from the table and hurried to the bathroom, where she pulled open the medicine cabinet, and fumbled through bottles and serums and creams until she found the orange prescription bottle where she kept Vicodin.She knew as soon as she picked it up that it was empty, but she unscrewed the lid anyway, the tears starting to flow as she cursed her two- and three- and four-days-ago selves for thinking she needed one to get through those nights without considering that tonight might be so, so, so much worse.She flung the empty bottle on the floor and let her sobs go, and when her eyes caught the reflection of her face, red and contorted and fat around Catherine’s nose, she hated it so much she couldn’t breathe. She ran back into the other room, where she dropped down onto her knees and reached for the box, picking out a piece of cupcake and jamming it into her mouth.It was chocolate-frosted chocolate, and she chewed it thoroughly, feeling each crystal of the frosting’s sugar disintegrate on her tongue and each moist cake morsel break down into thirty-six calories she added, like satisfied confirmation, to the tally of her self-disgust.A little voice inside her said, That’s enough, but Lauren ignored it, watching her hand reach for another piece.This one was vanilla coated in rainbow sprinkles, and it tasted good and so she looked for the other half of it and, when she saw it on the floor, ate it, too, along with the red velvet piece, frosting glued to it.The voice said, Don’t, but Lauren knew it didn’t have any real power, and so she went back to the box and picked off the buttery, moist tops of four relatively intact cupcakes, and when she’d finished them, she ate the dry bottom pieces too.She ate mechanically, watching herself as she shuffled cake from hand to mouth to down her throat, starting with the big pieces and then the small pieces and, when they were gone, picking the crumbs out of the rug. She wiped the frosting off the wall and put it into her mouth, then licked the inside of the box for any crumb she might have missed.When she was satisfied she had gotten it all, she pushed up from the floor and went into the kitchen, where she pulled down a glass and took it to the sink and filled it with water she drank in gulps.There wasn’t room in her bodice for it with all the cupcakes, but she drank another glassful anyway, and then the rest of the coconut milk in the refrigerator, and she also ate the orange and half pack of almonds that were the only other food in the apartment, just so everything would be gone.And then Lauren turned out of the kitchen and reached to unzip her dress, letting it drop to the floor, her naked belly so swollen she no longer needed a designer’s sizing to verify that she was fat. She walked to the bathroom, where she turned on the light but ignored her reflection as she passed the mirror to the toilet and lifted the lid.She bent down over it and opened her mouth, unhinging her jaw and flattening her tongue to make room for her hand as she extended her index finger and pressed it to the back of her throat. There, she wagged her forefinger until it found the soft flesh it was looking for, which she petted with firm little strokes.It was sensitive and began to pulse, whereupon she pressed her hand deeper into her mouth, blocking the airwaves. Maybe it made her kinky, but she enjoyed the sensation of being choked: she liked the way it heightened the intensity and pushed her mind toward shutting down, creating a standoff between pleasure and pain that always ended in—Release.Her throat’s sphincter gave way and her abdomen convulsed, unleashing thick globs of partially digested batter that rolled over her tongue and hand and splashed into the toilet bowl.When the wave was almost finished, she pressed her finger back into her throat, letting the acrid, sweet taste of the previous round’s residue arouse her gag reflex more quickly this time, as her stomach pumped one-two-three rounds so hard it left her out of breath.Tears started to form in her eyes and her stomach cramped as it lurched again, but Lauren pushed through it, squeezing her brow as she dug two fingers in this time, ignoring the sting of her fingernail as it scratched her throat, because her mother wasn’t the only one with the skill and stamina to do things as well as they could be done.When she was sure that all that was left was bile and acid, Lauren gripped the sides of the toilet and panted greedily to catch her breath. And when her heart had returned to a normal pace, she reached up to flush the toilet, then watched as everything that had happened swirled down and away, leaving the porcelain clean.She took one last deep breath before standing up and calmly reached for toilet paper to wipe off the few splatters on the seat and floor, then flushed it away, too. She moved to the sink and washed her hands with soap until her fingers smelled like rose essence, then reached for her toothpaste to brush her teeth.She flossed as well and swished with the cavity-protection mouthwash her dentist had recommended. She used a cleansing wipe to remove her eye makeup, then washed her face and gently patted it dry. She dabbed La Mer cream under her eyes and along her laugh lines, the way her mother had taught her to do, smoothed Vaseline across her lips, and unpinned her hair to brush it out long.When she was finished, she filled the bathroom cup with water and watched her reflection as the liquid ran across her raw throat. Then Lauren took one final look at herself and smiled, proud, because the gallery was really going to be something.And with that in mind, she turned out the light and went to her bedroom and climbed under the crisp, clean sheets. And before she fell asleep, she reached for her phone and texted her mother: Thanks.ABOUT THE AUTHOR [image file=image_rsrc4Z.jpg] Photo © Khristopher MorganMichelle Miller wrote pseudonymously until the publication of her debut novel, The Underwriting, which was translated into twenty languages and developed for television with Fox.
